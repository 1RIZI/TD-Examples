# Python in TouchDesigner #

## Programmer / Artist ##

## Overview ##

Whoa nelly! Welcome to a set of examples helping you get started with Python 3 in TouchDesigner. With any luck you're either new to TouchDesigner, or Python. If, however, like a growing number of artists you happen to be new to both of those things this is for you. Don't get me wrong, this is likely to be helpful to lots of folks, but if you're new to programming and feeling a little intimidated by the text port and writing scripts this should help you feel a little better about the world. Examples here will run the gamut of the mundane to the interesting, so don't be surprised if you find yourself a little bored while you're noodling around these examples. That's okay, these examples are here for you to come back to and look through at your own pace.

Many examples here come from the lessons I learned by going though the brilliant [Zed Shaw's ](http://zedshaw.com/) book - [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/). I can't recommend this book / ebook enough for those of you new to Python. Read it, re-read it, re-re-read it. It's definitely worth going through several times.

Happy Programming

### example_print ###

*Overview*

Printing out lines isn't especially interesting on the face of it. That being said, this is one of the most powerful places to get your bearings. I almost always start any python related task by printing out bits of pieces of what I'm up to. It lets me see into the otherwise invisible process of code execution. Many folks will swear by this or that debugger, but at the end of the day your best debugging tool is just printing out what's happening. Learning the ins and outs of printing will also transfer to a number of different bits and pieces along the way. We'll start here as a way to get a solid handle on a few basic elements.
